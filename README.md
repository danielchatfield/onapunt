# On a Punt

On a Punt is a flask app running on Google App Engine. The structure of the
flask app borrows from:

 - [Overholt]
 - [Python Flask Skeleton for Google App Engine][flask-skeleton]
 - Armin Ronacher's [Large App Guide].

I love well documented code so feel free to have a gander, over time I will probably fill this readme or the wiki with information about the application structure and deployment process but it is not a priority right now and the application structure is still somewhat in flux.

The code base is licensed under the interesting Artistic-2.0 license.
